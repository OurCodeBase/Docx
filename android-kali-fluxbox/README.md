Use any password what you want,
But in `view-only` password section only use `n` and hit the `enter` button.


I hope you understand how to use vnc viewer app. If not i will make a tutorial for you.

#### Warning !
* Don't use `vncstart` or `vncstop` command twice.
* First use `vncstart` command and then `vncstop`.
* Always use `vncstop` command after using `kali linux` gui.

Otherwise these shortcut commands will not work.
